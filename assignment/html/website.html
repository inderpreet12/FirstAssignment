<h1 id="heading1">ABS</h1>
<p id="exercise1" >I am not an advocate of cheat meals or cheat days, so if you are fully dedicated to your abs, these foods will have to be given up for the duration of your cutting. For best results, I suggest staying away from social settings where food is the focus, and I also suggest emptying your refrigerators and pantries of these fattening snacks. If it's there, you'll eventually eat it.

<p id="exercise2"> Grab a pair of dumbbells and let them hang at arm’s length next to your sides—either your thumbs or pinkies should rest right next to one of the heads of your dumbbells. Without moving your upper arms, bend your elbows and curl the dumbbells as close to your shoulders as you can. Pause, then slowly lower the weight back to the starting position. Each time you return to the starting position, completely straighten your arms.</p>

<p id="exercise3">Mass-building comes with a set of rules. That means starting your workout with the most challenging exercises and heaviest loads, hitting the thighs from a variety of angles, keeping the volume (number of total sets and reps) high, and training to muscle failure</p>

       <h2 id="whey1"> CREATINE</h2>
       <p style="color:blue">Creatine is most commonly used for improving exercise performance and increasing muscle mass in athletes and older adults. There is some science supporting the use of creatine in improving the athletic performance of young, healthy people during brief high-intensity activity such as sprinting. Because of this, creatine is often used as a dietary supplement to improve muscle strength and athletic performance. In the U.S., a majority of sports nutritionsupplements, which total $2.7 billion in annual sales, contain creatine.</p>
